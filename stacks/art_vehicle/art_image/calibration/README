This folder includes calbiration files for the cameras. Each camera has a 'camera_matrix' (3x3), 'distortion coefficients' (1x5), rectification_matrix' (3x3), and 'projection_matrix' (3x4). No comments so I can't really tell for sure what these are but I can make some guesses. The camera matrix must be 3 vectors though I'm not sure whether they're row vectors or column vectors. The distortion coefficients have the distortion model: plumb_bob, so maybe this must be some kind of error correction tool? The rectification matrix seems to also be 3 vectors, maybe for use with the distortion coefficents for correction? Then projection matrix seems to be very similar to the camera_matrix, but with some 0's inserted at places to make it 3x4. Hopefully these will become more clear as  I keep looking through the rest of the code.
